			<h2>What is Proposition #2?</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Proposition #2 would gut the New Orleans Public Library’s budget, cutting 40%
for the next 20 years.</strong> Mayor Cantrell claims this measure would “renew” library
funding. In reality, prop #2 cuts the millage that funds the library, and redirects
those funds elsewhere.
			</p>

			<h2>How much money does Proposition #2 cut?</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>The library system would lose $7.5 million in 2021 alone.</strong> The current millage
rate of 2.58 provides the majority of the library’s funding. Proposition #2 would
cut this millage to 0.987.
			</p>

			<h2>Where would these funds go?</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>Most of the library’s lost funding would wind up in an “economic development”
slush fund.</strong> The propositions on the Dec 5 ballot redistribute taxpayer money
into three new mayor-controlled funds, with little taxpayer accountability.
			</p>

			<h2>Would the library lose its independence?</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Yes.</strong> Instead of taxpayer money going directly to the library system, proposition
#2 would funnel reduced funding into a “library and early education fund”
controlled by the mayor.
			</p>

			<h2>Will library services be cut? Will branches close?</h2>
			<p>
				The library spends 97% of its budget on operating costs most years. There is no
doubt that a 40% budget cut will mean reductions in services, branches closing,
and library workers furloughed.
			</p>

			<h2>Is this related to COVID-19?</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>No.</strong> Cuts to the library budget were fi rst proposed in
2019. This millage isn’t about austerity or unforeseen
circumstances.
			</p>

			<h2>What happens if Proposition #2 fails?</h2>
			<p>
				If voters reject Proposition #2, the current millage
would remain in place until it expires at the end
of 2021. This would aff ord the community an
opportunity to propose a millage in line with the
funding voters have previously approved for the
library.
